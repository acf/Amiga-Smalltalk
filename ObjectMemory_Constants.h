 *       there's a constant called MethodClass which is the class for compiled methods.
 *       Meanwhile, on p576 there's a definition of the "guaranteed pointers", which
 *       doesn't include CompiledMethod. I have taken the liberty of defining it.
 *       Even if you could write CompiledMethod entirely in Smalltalk, the ObjectMemory
 *       needs to know the class entry for CompiledMethods. If we can construct a
 *       GetClassByName() routine in both C and Smalltalk, this isn't needed.
