/**
 * This register indicates whether a primitive method succeeded.
 * @note if the interpreter were written in Smalltalk, it would be possible to tell that failure
 *       has been returned from a method rather than a real value. But it isn't, and because most
 *       methods return object pointers (which are 16-bit words) or integers (same), there's no
 *       sentinel value that can be used. Additionally, we don't want to use longjmp() or a
 *       similar fake exception mechanism, because we need Smalltalk, not C, to recover from
 *       primitive method failures. We could use an out error parameter, but that would have a pervasive
 *       impact on the signatures of routines across the system. Therefore the official, supported way in
 *       this Smalltalk to test whether a primitive method failed is to check the value of the success
 *       register on return. If it's NO, then you shouldn't rely on the returned value.
